## 🚦 Understanding Slot Colors

The Home screen shows you the live status of every parking slot. Here is what the colors mean:

-   🟢 **Green (AVAILABLE)**: This slot is completely free. You can park here now or book it for a future time.
-   🟠 **Orange (BOOKED)**: This slot is reserved by another user. Their arrival is expected within the next 30 minutes.
-   🔴 **Red (OCCUPIED)**: A vehicle is currently parked in this slot.
-   🟣 **Purple (YOUR SPOT)**: This is your reserved slot! You have an active booking or your arrival time is within 30 minutes.

## 📱 How to Book a Slot

Booking a spot is simple and takes less than a minute:

1.  **Select a Slot**: On the Home tab, look for a **Green** slot and tap it.
2.  **Fill Details**: Enter your vehicle registration number and select your vehicle type.
3.  **Set Arriving Time**: Choose exactly when you plan to arrive at the parking space.
4.  **Choose Duration**: Select how long you need the spot (30 mins to 4 hours).
5.  **Confirm**: Enter your account password to verify and finalize the payment.

> **💡 Smart Tip**: The app automatically protects you from double-bookings. If you try to book a time that overlaps with someone else (including their 30-minute arrival buffer), the app will notify you with a "Conflict" message.

## 🎫 Using Your Booking

Once booked, your reservation will appear in the **Bookings** tab.

-   **View QR**: When you arrive, tap "VIEW QR" to show your confirmation code to the parking attendant.
-   **Live Timer**: Each booking card shows a live countdown of your remaining parking time.
-   **End Session**: If you leave early, you can tap "END" to release the slot for other users.

## 🛡️ Important Rules

-   **Arrival Buffer**: Your slot turns from Green to Purple (for you) and Orange (for others) exactly **30 minutes before** your chosen arrival time.
-   **Physical Occupancy**: If you park in a slot without booking, or if someone else parks in your spot, the status will turn **Red (Occupied)** based on the real-time IoT sensors.
